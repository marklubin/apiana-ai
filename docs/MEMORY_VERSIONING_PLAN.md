# Memory Versioning & Composition Plan

## Future Enhancement: Versioned Memory System

### Concept
Treat memories like git repositories where different strategies and processing runs create versioned layers that can be composed at runtime.

### Use Cases
1. **A/B Testing Strategies**: Compare different summarization approaches
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Layer additional analysis without losing originals
3. **Strategy Composition**: Mix and match different processing strategies
4. **Rollback Capability**: Revert to previous versions if new strategies fail

### Proposed Architecture

#### Version Tracking
```python
# Each memory would include:
version_id: "v1.0.0-exp-adaptive"  # version-branch-strategy
parent_version: "v0.9.0-exp-basic"  # What this was derived from
generation_strategy: {
    "method": "experiential",
    "model": "llama3.2",
    "prompt_version": "1.0",
    "pipeline": "adaptive-embedding-v2"
}
```

#### Composition Example
```python
# Runtime can compose multiple versions:
memory_view = compose_layers([
    "base-experiential-v1",      # Original summary
    "contextual-tags-v2",        # Added emotional/environmental context
    "semantic-embedding-v3",     # Optimized embeddings
    "knowledge-extraction-v1"    # Entity relationships
])
```

### Benefits
1. **Non-destructive Updates**: Never lose original processing
2. **Strategy Evolution**: Test new approaches without risk
3. **Personalization**: Different users can have different strategy stacks
4. **Debugging**: Trace how memories evolved through versions

### Implementation Considerations
- Need version relationships (parent/child)
- Strategy metadata for each version
- Composition rules for merging layers
- Query system that understands versions

### Deferred Until
- Basic system is working and stable
- Clear need for A/B testing strategies
- Multiple processing strategies implemented
- Performance requirements understood

## Related: Adaptive Embedding Strategy

### Concept
Before generating embeddings, query existing similar memories to understand the semantic space and optimize the embedding text.

### Process
1. Generate initial embedding from raw text
2. Query for similar existing memories
3. Analyze the semantic neighborhood
4. Optimize text based on what works in that space
5. Generate final embedding

### Benefits
- Self-improving embeddings over time
- Better semantic clustering
- Context-aware optimization
- Fills semantic gaps intelligently

### Example
```python
# Raw: "Fixed the Docker issue"

# After querying similar memories, optimize to:
# "DevOps: Resolved Docker container configuration issue.
#  Context: debugging, containerization, deployment.
#  Technical area: infrastructure, orchestration."
```

### Implementation Notes
- Requires initial embeddings to bootstrap
- Could slow down processing initially
- Benefits compound over time
- Consider caching optimization strategies

### Deferred Until
- Basic embedding system working
- Sufficient memories for meaningful patterns
- Performance impact assessed
